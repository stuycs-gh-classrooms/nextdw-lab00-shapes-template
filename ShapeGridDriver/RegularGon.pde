/* ===================================
RegularGon

A ReularGon is a Polygon but when the points are
generated they are all the same distance from
the center point.

The center should always be in the middle of the
square region defined by the corner and shapeSize
instance vairables.

Whem making a new RegularGon, the radius should be
a random number in the range [20, shapeSize)
divided by 2.

A valid RegularGon is once with an area that is
larger than (shapeSize^2)/4.

toString should return "Regulragon" and the
number of points.

Write the entire RegularGon class, only overriding
the necessary methods to create a RegularGon as
described above, and using super appropriately.

Read the comment at the top of ShapeGrid for an example
of the requred constructor (line 9)
